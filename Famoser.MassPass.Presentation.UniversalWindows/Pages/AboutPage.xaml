                <Paragraph>MassPass is a masterPassword collection, you use it to save all your masterPassword and account data</Paragraph>

                <Paragraph>
                    MassPass allows you to create a masterPassword collection; all your masterPasswords and account data at the same place.
                    You won't need to remember masterPasswords anymore, and therefore can choose different, strong masterPasswords for each one of your logins.
                    All your data is then synced over all your devies, so you will have everything with you at all times.

                <Paragraph>
                    You secure your masterPassword collection with a master masterPassword, one very safe masterPassword only you know.
                    Some other authentication methods may be added later on, like your fingerprint or a rythm</Paragraph>


                <Paragraph Margin="0,10,0,0">
                    <Bold>Can I recover my data if I forget my master masterPassword?</Bold>

                <Paragraph>
                    No, you cannot. All files are saved encrypted, only with your master masterPassword will you be able to decrypt them. 
                    Noone has access to your masterPassword collection but you.

                <Paragraph>
                    All data is encrypted, and then send to a the server (in switzerland), attached to an identifier. All devices which have that identifier can download those encrypted files.
                    If they are able to decrypt it (with the correct master masterPassword) they can view or edit it.
                    The edit history of your entries is saved, you can see which device has made the last changes, and you will even be able to revert a change you no longer need</Paragraph>
